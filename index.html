						<h1>Oh look, a visitor!</h1>
						<img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:510px;"/>
						<p>Hello there! I'm <u><b>Abhishek Panhale</b></u>, an individual interested in exploring the field of Game Development 
							and proudly being a part of the Game industry. Presently, I'm pursuing a MS Degree in Game Design and Development at 
							Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester. Previously I used to work as a Software Engineer at Ingram Micro India SSC Pvt. Ltd. 
							I changed my field of interest as I always feel that nothing would make me happier than creating something I really love. 
							I'm learning a lot from my current courses in graduation and also from my peers who are more experience than me in this field.
							Based on my experiences uptil now, my interests fall in Gameplay Programming, Game Design and Animations. 
							<br/>When I'm not doing any of these, you would find me gaming, playing different sports, watching anime, sketching, listening to music and some more gaming!
							I would love to chat about job opportunities, projects I've worked on, or just some nice things!

									<p>
										1) Click the project image for a link to download the gameplay video
										<br/>
										2) Click on the buttons to view some files I've uploaded for reference.
										<br/>
										3) Most of these projects do not have a quit option as far as their builds<br/> 
										   are concerned. Please use 'Alt+Enter' to load up the Menu bar in <br/>

									<p>HatMancers is a multiplayer third-person arena shooter game created using the Unity 3D Game Engine. 
										You take control of a wizard and pick up different hats in order to use magics associated with them. 
										Currently the game has a Free-For-All game mode with support for 2-4 players. 
										The goal is to get the maximum number of knockouts before the timer runs out. 
									<br/><b>This project was a part of one of my graduation courses. My contribution to this project was towards 
										UI elements, Animation and Level Design. Additionally, the course was more about Game Development processes
										and we followed an agile Scrum approach for the same. This also consisted of multiple pitch presentations and playtests by the target audience.</b></p>

									<p>ECS Space Simulation is an attempt at implementing the Data-Oriented version of Unity Development. 
										It consists of a rotating Sun and moving asteroids, implemented using the Entity-Component-System of Unity 3D Game Engine.
									<br/><b>This project was a part of one of my graduation courses. Unity is coming up with a Data-Oriented development approach
										 as an improvement over their traditional Object-Oriented development in terms of performance. 
										 The simulation contained about a 1000 asteroid objects and still provides a 60+ FPS which is really impressive.</b></p>

										The goal of the game is to move around in a restricted space and shoot down boxes to score points before the timer runs out. 
										Three different colors of boxes get spawned; namely Green(earns points), White(earns time) and Yellow(cuts time). 
									<br/><b>This is a personal project wherein apart from the usual C# scripting, I was able to explore the Animator 
										used in the Unity Game Engine to scale and move the boxes as defined. </b></p>

										The Simulation consists of a rotating Sun and few planets rotating around it.
									<br/><b>This is one of my few initial personal projects in Unity where I learnt using quarternions to rotate objects automatically per frame. 
										Also, I got the opportunity to implement a multiple cameras, both of which are interactive
										 i.e. clicking on one planet shifts the main camera focus to that planet.

										<h2>Starry Sky - Game Design</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A world succumbed to darkness.
										What if something other than consciousness, controlled our state of mind?
										Have you been a part of the wrong side to know if it is really wrong?
										In Starry Sky, be the ultimate sword master and bring back daylight, by exterminating the creatures of the dark. 
										That is.....until you realise you're becoming one yourself!!!
										<br/><b>This project was a part of one of my graduation courses and my first attempt at writing a Game Design Document. 
											My contributions to this design document are in the Gameplay features, 
											Gameplay progression and the Level design of the first zone in this game. The overall process really helped me realise the kind of questions we need to answer, 
											right from small details in the game itself to how a player playing the game would reciprocate.</b></p>
